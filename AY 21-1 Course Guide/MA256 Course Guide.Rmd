## Update: 6 JULY 2020

## Task
Develop critical statistical thinkers who can generate precise research questions; identify, collect, and analyze relevant data; and translate this analysis to a complete and correct response that answers the original question.

## Purpose
Our daily lives are full of question whose answers should be informed by the growing amount of data surrounding us. Politicians, scientists, sports teams, and military leaders are all looking toward quantitative analysis to provide them with unbiased information with which to make the correct decision. In this course you will gain valuable experience using data in an investigation process to collect, analyze, and report your results to help answer relevant research questions.

You will gain experience in not only completing statistical analysis but also asking the important follow-up questions about why you are getting these results and how you can expect them to change if the experiment was repeated. You will also gain experience in reading, comprehending, and reproducing the results of published scientific papers. All of these tools will help to equip you to be successful in the course project where you are provided the opportunity to do research on a question that interests you. Perhaps you will discover, like some of your fellow cadets that, indeed, more cadets do report to sick call on Mondays.

## How to use this guide:
The purpose of this course guide is to give you a single document that lists what you need to complete for this course. Given the nature of the learning environment we are in this semester, you can expect that there will be changes to this guide.  I will attempt to notify you whenever there are large updates but the version available on my GitHub (and at the top of the Teams) will always be the latest version.  

You will see that there are "Before Class Activities" and "After Class Activities." Hopefully these are pretty self-explanatory. I include "After Class Activities" because I feel that a lot of the "homework" you have will be easier if you complete/think about right after a given class period as opposed to right before the next.  I won't be checking though so you do what works best for you. 

I have adopted a "Read - Watch - Do" model for laying out your activities.  These tasks are the minimum you are expected to complete. There will be some videos assigned that are located under the "Modules" section under our course in WileyPlus. There are a lot more videos available on WileyPlus and please feel free to watch extra videos if it will aid in your understanding. Your textbook also has a lot of exercises if you want some extra practice.

You will see references to example code in many of the lessons. I have seperated out this code to shorten the course guide a little bit. These files are available for you in the main folder of the MA256 GitHub repository. You will see there are **.rmd** files and **.pdf** files. Hopefully you are familiar with PDF files but these RMD (or RMarkdown) files are what I use to produce the PDF files. You will be expected to learn how to use RMarkdown in this course so these files will provide several examples for you (in addition to the countless examples on the internet). You will also notice that I haven't hidden any code from you, even when it's ugly and complicated. I want you to see the types of things you can do with *R*.

I want to instill a sense of responsibility and ownership of your learning in this course. I have a high expectation of your level of mastery of the concepts, you do what is necessary to get yourself to that level.

### After Class Activities:
* Ensure that R/RStudio is installed and functional on your computer.
* Carefully go through the *Tidyverse Tutorial*.  Attention now will save you a great deal of time later.
* Consider the dataset that we discussed in class today, what sort of research questions could you ask based on the data and variables present in this dataset.  No need to answer the questions, but develop three good research questions before next class.
